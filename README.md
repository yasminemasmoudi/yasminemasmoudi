## 👋 Hey there! I'm Yasmine  
### Software & Data Engineer | Cloud & MLOps Enthusiast

I build scalable data systems and AI-powered solutions.  
If an idea excites me, I’ll prototype it, test it, refine it, and ship it 🚀.

I design and develop:

- ⚡ **Real-time & batch data pipelines** (PySpark, Spark, Kafka, Airflow)  
- ☁️ **Cloud solutions** on AWS, Azure, and GCP  
- 🧠 **Machine Learning & MLOps workflows** 
- 🛠️ Backend & full-stack prototypes when needed

My current stack includes **Python, SQL, PySpark, Airflow, Snowflake, dbt, Docker, Terraform**, and **Palantir Foundry**.

## 💡 What I Love  
- Turning raw data into **scalable, production-ready systems**  
- Automating workflows & improving pipeline performance  
- Exploring new cloud tools and big data technologies  
- Designing clean, efficient architectures
